<p>Hello friends how are you and how are you doing. I am your brother in low Ibrahim Al hadi I hope my web page please you I am trying to make great web page in order to share my idea to you </p>
<p>I am not saying that I know a lot just some half. So anyway I wish to make some thing bright as well as a Designer. Honorable friends your commons are very important for me I want to know about my web page if it has value or not that it's all Dears.</p>
<p>“Great discoveries and improvements invariably involve the cooperation of many minds. I may be given credit for having blazed the trail, but when I look at the subsequent developments I feel the credit is due to others rather than to myself.”</p>
<p>brothers and sisters why we don't engage together in order to skip the problems of Asylum.
Brothers and Sisters once again Asylum it isn't solution for us.
Do you see , every places that we have been in it the nation of that place don't like us to be there.
So please i beg you again and again try to motivate yourself forward because we expect something form you also we need all of us to be in our homelands.
A real reality we don't want to be refugees at all but unfortunately a genocide forced us to be refugees
Also a place that we are refugees in it , nation of that place they don't like to accept us as refugees they are trying to deny us from our civil right.
I knew when the country suffered from political instability it makes it even harder to provide health and Education service for the people.
it can also damage the economy and making poverty much worse
So we are suffering from all of these points the question remains as it is.
why they are trying to ignore their responsibilities</p>
